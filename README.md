# Security e-mail & forms (anti-spam)
Module can:

# protected e-mail
Spammers create robots that go to sites and collect e-mail addresses. Then these address bases are sold and spam is sent to them.

The solution works on JavaScript encoding e-mail in html and JavaScript code.

You can place an e-mail in the form of text or a link. You can also add your own class in the component settings for the html element in which e-mail will be placed.
